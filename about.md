I am an interdisciplinary data scientist and teacher, with special interests in data visualization and statistical software development, especially in the R ecosystem.

My full-time job is on the data science team at [Imbellus](https://www.imbellus.com/), a venture-backed startup that is building simulation-based cognitive assessments. At Imbellus I write scoring software, develop predictive models of hiring outcomes, and conduct analyses to inform assessment designs. I also present to clients, interview candidates for our growing team, and work across disciplines with our psychometricians, learning scientists, game designers, and engineers.

I also teach a [course](https://ubc-mds.github.io/2017-11-10-DSCI-542-communication/) on communication and argumentation in the [Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.science.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia. The course is about how to be clear, persuasive, and judicious when writing, speaking, and programming in data science contexts.
