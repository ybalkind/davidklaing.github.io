- no side projects
- no diligent note-taking
- stop tracking your habits
- stop trying to produce content

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“All of those are great, and I'd add one more: for every tweet you send, reply to someone else.

Finding conversational accounts is great, but you have to also *be* a conversational account.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Confirmation bias makes a lot more sense under the lens, "people don't have ideas, ideas have people."

When someone's views are challenged and they start digging in their heels, what you're really seeing is the thrashing of a parasite that has a death grip on its host.”</p>&mdash; David Laing (@davidklaing) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1163841215017750529">August 20, 2019</a></blockquote>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Responsiveness is such an underrated ingredient for friendship.

Responsive friendships self-sustain via positive feedback loops; laggy ones suffocate via negative feedback loops.”</p>&mdash; David Laing (@davidklaing) <a href="https://twitter.com/davidklaing/status/1225685248786059266">February 6, 2020</a></blockquote>

✅ Keep track of everything in my head

✅ Download a new productivity app
