## Books

I didn't read as many books this year as usual. I would say that there were only two books I really loved, which I would confidently recommend to any curious friend:

* [*Algorithms to Live By*](https://www.amazon.ca/Algorithms-Live-Computer-Science-Decisions/dp/1627790365), by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths
	* It's rare that I read a book that touches on so many foundational concepts in an academic discipline (in this case, computer science) and also relates to so much of daily life. I finished this book in early October, and I've thought about it almost every week since.
* [*The Happiness Hypothesis*](https://www.amazon.ca/Happiness-Hypothesis-Finding-Modern-Ancient/dp/0465028020/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1514328713&sr=1-1&keywords=the+happiness+hypothesis), by Jonathan Haidt
	* *The Happiness Hypothesis* is to psychology as *Algorithms to Live By* is to computer science. Haidt is an incredible writer, and I've thought about ideas in this book many times since I finished it.

There were several others that I liked quite a bit, but which I would recommend more tentatively. Alphabetically by author's last name:

* *How to Fail at Everything and Still Win Big*, by Scott Adams
* *Superintelligence*, by Nick Bostrom
* *Sapiens*, by Yuval Noah Harrari
* *Homo Deus*, by Yuval Noah Harrari
* *The Nurture Assumption*, by Judith Rich Harris
* *Chaos*, by James Gleick
* *Never Let Me Go*, by Kazuo Ishiguro
* *Houston, We Have a Narrative*, by Randy Olson
* *Everybody Lies*, by Seth Stevens-Davidowitz
* *Inadequate Equilibria*, by Eliezer Yudkowsky

I don't often reread books, but this year I reread two. That fact alone should recommend them:

* [*The Sense of Style*](https://www.amazon.ca/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0670025852/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1514328774&sr=1-1&keywords=the+sense+of+style), by Steven Pinker
* [*Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality*](http://www.hpmor.com/), by Eliezer Yudkowsky

I also read [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) from start to finish, which felt like quite an accomplishment. I think this was the first time I've ever read an entire textbook. For anyone who aspires to do this sort of thing, I highly recommend forming a reading group with two to three others. Two of my friends and I read a chapter or two each week, and met for a few hours to talk through the practice problems.

## TV and Movies

I didn't watch too many new movies or shows this year, so if your favourite isn't included here, it's more likely that I didn't see it than that I saw it but didn't like it.
