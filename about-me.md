## What's my story?

I grew up in Peterborough, Ontario. It was a wonderful and fortunate childhood, filled with fantasy novels, James Taylor albums, canoe trips, and chlorine.

I studied everything and nothing in McMaster University's interdisciplinary [Arts & Science program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMaster_Arts_and_Science), where I found my people.

After a year of teaching writing at a Niagara College in Welland, Ontario, I decided to train as a data scientist. I moved to the west coast to study in the first cohort of the [Master of Data Science program](https://masterdatascience.ubc.ca/) at the University of British Columbia.

I now live in Vancouver with my partner. I love listening to music, playing chess, bouldering with friends, and biking everywhere no matter how hard it's raining.

## What do I do for work?

I'm a senior data scientist at [Imbellus](https://imbellus.com/), an LA-based startup that makes simulation-based cognitive assessments, for use by employers and educators.

I write scoring logic, develop predictive models of hiring outcomes, and do analyses to inform assessment designs. I also present to clients, interview candidates for our growing team, and collaborate with psychometricians, learning scientists, game designers, AI researchers, and engineers.

See this [Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2019-03-19/a-harvard-dropout-s-plan-to-fix-college-admissions-with-video-games) to learn more about the company, or watch our CEO Rebecca Kantar's talk at [Google](youtube.com/watch?v=JoTlMNamSAg).
